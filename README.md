Two simple Labs completed as part of a 'Front-End Web Development with React' course through Coursera.

  creates a simple todo list that utilizes one component, state, and local storage.
  I added one extra feature: invalid input, which was, by default, an alert.

  utilizes Redux to manage the state of each
  the user clicks the button, the incrementer increments
